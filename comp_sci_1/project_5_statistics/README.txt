Not-So-Elementary Statistics

This project was designed to help is determine how to write different statistical tools without using the built is function in the Math module. 

The functions that we built were:
* maximum
* minimum
* average
* standard deviation
* count value
* mode

This aided me in being more confident when in the future if we need a function and it is unavailable, I are able to figure out exactly what I need out of the function and write it individually without searching for libraries for hours.

That is all that this project was. 

Thank you for reading!
