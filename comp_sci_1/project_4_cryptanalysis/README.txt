Cryptanalysis

This project is for learning how to decrypt cipher text. A cryptogram (as they are more commonly referred to as) is a series of what seem to be illegible words; however, there is a pattern where the letters in the cryptogram represent other letters making it a puzzle of figuring out which letters correspond to the correct ones in order to decode the message. 

There were a couple of functions that we used to make this possible including a "suggest_substitutions" function that based, on the length of the word, the function will suggest common substitutions given that the cipher was written in English and with relatively simple words. 

Then there was a "substitute" function that substituted the words in the cryptogram with words that are recognizable thus assigning those letters. 

There were other functions for formatting and checking on incorrect inputs. 

Overall, there were 2 cryptograms assigned for us to decode using our functions. 

EC:
For the extra credit portion of this assignment, we were assigned to decode a cryptogram that had no spaces so we had to study the placement of certain letters throughout the cipher instead of the spaces. An example would be looking for letters that repeat one after the other or a constant repetition of 2 letters that are different but are seen often (making it a more common word like "an"). 

There are docstrings for each function for a more in-depth explanation of the functions.
