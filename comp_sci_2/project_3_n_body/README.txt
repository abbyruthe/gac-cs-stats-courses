This project was a project that was creating an animation of N number of bodies that when acting upon each other, the gravitational pulls of the objects will act in a specific manner. The entire explanation for the project can be found here:

To give a brief synopsis, we had many equations that we hardcoded in in order to calculate the many different quantities of the bodies as they were moving and repelling each other. We used Std.Draw to draw out the animation of the bodies as well. 

There was a lot of components of this project and reading through the material as well as the guidelines for the project (seen here: http://homepages.gac.edu/~lyu/teaching/mcs178-f20/project3.html) may make understanding it easier. 

Please email me with any questions my email can be found on my website which is located under my username.
