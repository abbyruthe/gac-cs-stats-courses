# Global Sequence Alignment

This project utilized dynamic programming with top-down (memoization) and bottom-up techniques to solve for the same problem. 

The whole idea for this project was to first generate 2 short, random DNA sequences and compute the edit distance between the 2 DNA strings with is computing the optimal sequence alignment of the 2.
