Recursive Graphics

This project focuses heavily on working with recursion and recursive carpets. 

The first task for this project was to create a Dragon.java that was similar to a file that can be found here: http://homepages.gac.edu/~lyu/teaching/mcs178-f20/CCurve.java
except for when the level was greater than 0, it switched the order (orientation) of the second sub curve. 

The second task was to create a program that drew the Sierpinski triangle. 

A more in-depth explanation of the problems at hand can be found here: http://homepages.gac.edu/~lyu/teaching/mcs178-f20/project4.html
