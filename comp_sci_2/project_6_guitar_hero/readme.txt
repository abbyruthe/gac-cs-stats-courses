/**********************************************************************
 *  Explain why it makes sense to have a separate RingBuffer class.
 **********************************************************************/
So you can reference it in multiple classes as long as the methods
are public. 

/**********************************************************************
 *  If you did one of the extra credits, name which one you did, 
 *  describe it here and write why it is interesting.
 **********************************************************************/
I did not complete any extra credits. 

/**********************************************************************
 *  Describe any serious problems you encountered.                    
 **********************************************************************/
I had troubles with figuring out GuitarString fully because I was 
not used to declaring an object in a class a type of object from a 
different class.

/**********************************************************************
 *  List whatever help (if any) that you received. You don't need to
 *  include the course materials or lectures, but do include any
 *  additional help your received from people other than course staff,
 *  and include their names.

 Sanjeeda and I worked on the RingBuffer class together. We were 
 bouncing ideas of each other to understand exactly what the methods 
 were asking me to do.
