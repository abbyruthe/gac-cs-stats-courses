Conditionals and Loops

This was our first project in Java. This projected consisted of solving little problems using programming that utilized the basics of Java such as conditionals, random library, loops and nested loops among other things. 

There are two folders in this project that contain the Java files which is in the "src" folder and the class files which is in the "bin" folder. 

Inside the "bin" folder, there are files that contain the code to the projects and the explanations are below:

Ordered.java

Ordered.java was a file that read in 3 integer command-line arguments, namely, x, y, and z and printed out a boolean. If the boolean were true, the inputs would have to be in strictly ascending or descending order. False otherwise. The boolean was defined by a variable isOrdered and that was what was printed. 

RGBtoCMYK.java

RGBtoCMYK.java was a file that converted the RBG inputs of R (red), G (green), and B (blue) to the CMYK format that defines C (cyan), M (magenta), Y (yellow), and K (black). 

Checkerboard.java

Checkerboard.java was a program that took an integer command-line argument N, and used 2 nested for loops to print an N-by-N "checkerboard" out of asterisks. There are a total number of N^2 asterisks and each row has 2N characters. 

randomWalker.java

randomWalker.java is a program that maps a drunkard's walk as they take steps that are completely random with a probability of .25 for going north, south, east, or west. So, this program took in an integer command-line argument N and it simulates the motion of a random walker for N steps. After each step that the drunkard takes, the program prints the location of the walk from where they started. Then finally, the program also prints the square of the final distance from the origin. 

randomWalkers2.java

randomWalkers2.java takes 2 integer command-line arguments N and T where T represents a set number of independent experiments and N once again represents N number of steps that the drunkard takes. Thus, the main output of this program is the mean squared distance or the average of the T squared distances.
